# Evaluating and Improving the Electra-small Model for NLI

This repository contains the code and analysis for a research paper that examines the performance of the Electra-small model (Clark et al., 2020) on a Natural Language Inference (NLI) dataset. The goal is to determine whether the model's high accuracy is due to genuine learning or if it's relying on shortcuts or biases.

## Contents

- **Introduction:** Provides an overview of the research paper's objectives and methodology.
- **Analysis:** Explores the use of Checklist sets and Contrast sets to assess the model's performance and identify potential shortcomings.
- **Conclusion:** Discusses the outcomes of training the model on adversarial datasets to address the identified weaknesses.

## Analysis Methods

1. **Checklist Sets:** Behavioral testing using linguistic capabilities to evaluate the model's understanding of sentiment, vocabulary, and part of speech (POS). Minimum Functionality tests (MFT) are employed to detect gaps in the model's capabilities.

2. **Contrast Sets:** Manually modified dataset examples that challenge the model's classification boundaries. This analysis helps reveal areas where the model might be misclassifying due to small dataset changes.

## Fixing the Model

The model's weaknesses highlighted in the analyses are addressed through training on adversarial datasets. This process aims to improve the model's generalization and robustness by exposing it to challenging examples.

## Results

The improved model's performance is evaluated using the original SNLI dataset and the Contrast sets. Comparisons with the base model demonstrate improvements in various aspects, including handling negations and ambiguous cases.

## Usage

The code and datasets used for this research are provided in this repository. Researchers and practitioners interested in NLP model evaluation and improvement can explore and extend the methods presented here.
